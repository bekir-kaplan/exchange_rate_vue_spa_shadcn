# Senior UI Developer Assignment exchangerate

Assignment
The idea is to create an interactive web application that allows users to display exchange rates over
time, using https://exchangeratesapi.io/ (Free 250 Monthly Requests).

The assignment does not have a tough time limit but we also do not want to take too much of
yourtime, so try to spend a maximum of 4 hours on it.

Inputs of the app should be a base currency, a target currency, and an amount for the base currency.
Try to implement these features keeping the following requirements in mind:
- It should be built using TypeScript and VueJS (Composition API).
- It should have a good looking, easy to understand interface. Show off some of your amazing skills
- It should minimize the number of API requests to make the app as efficient as possible
- It should be built with flexibility in mind, for example being able to switch data provider easily

## After you finish the assignment, please answer the following questions:
- How much time did you end up spending on it?
- What are some of the design decisions you made?
- What do you like about your implementation?
- What would you improve next time?
What is more

- Feel free to use any test framework if it runs without any additional dependencies
How to Submit

- Zip and email it to work@franx.com

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.
